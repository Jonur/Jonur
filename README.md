## About me

I am Dimitris, a politically incorrect foodie and nerdy developer, who loves heavy metal, history and whisky. People also call me Jonur, it's a long story.

<summary>My professional story</summary>
After completing my studies of IT & CS at the University of West Attica, I finished my internship at ATEbank, where I developed small-scale database management systems. Then, I joined Amoweb, where I worked on Flash websites and WAMP stack. Afterwards, I served my mandatory military service at the Hellenic Army as a radar operator and finally, self-employed, I worked on small-scale web projects.

In 2012, two friends and I decided to create our project, cmagnet. We delivered Graphic Design, Corporate Identity, small websites and e-shops to small businesses. Three years later, I moved to the UK, where I landed at Ladbrokes as a Front End Developer. Working on a WAMP stack in a Scrum team responsible for the development and support of the online betting platforms, I was also taking care of the integrations and support.

It was time for Whitbread to be my house next. In the role of Developer, I worked on the front-end of an AEM with AngularJS stack in one of the Premier Inn website's Scrum teams. Then, as a Senior Developer in the same company and Product, I co-led a React/Redux migration on top of the rest.

At the moment, I am working for the Photobox's Editor team as a full stack developer on React and Node stacks.

The Editor is a data-driven React (JS/JSX, Redux) application, which uses AWS services, mainly Lambdas and S3s, in order to provide a book creation interface with various toolboxes, store and edit the user's creation, as well as prepare the creation for the physical printing process. Continuous Integration pipelines and Continuous Deployment practices are used to ensure a very efficient workflow.

Being part of that, my responsibilities include the development and support of new Editor features, the improvement of the existing features, as well as managing the data used and slightly be involved with the web services.
