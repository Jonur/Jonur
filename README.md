I build low-drama, high-quality software. Everything else I like is intense, old, or fermented.
People call me Jonur — it’s a long story.

### My professional story

I’m a Staff Engineer based in London, currently working mainly in the React / TypeScript / Node.js space, with a strong interest in architecture, developer experience, and building things that don’t collapse under their own weight a year later.

These days my work sits less in “shipping isolated features” and more in shaping platforms: defining front-end foundations, setting standards, writing ADRs, unblocking teams, and rebuilding systems that have reached the end of their useful life. I tend to get pulled into the messy, cross-team problems — the ones where requirements are fuzzy, ownership is unclear, and the solution needs both technical depth and a lot of communication.

At Tractable, I’ve spent the last few years working across Pocket AI, the Inspection Portal, and the Auto Platform Product (APP). That’s included everything from running AI models client-side with TensorFlow.js, to rebuilding large React applications from scratch, to designing shared libraries used across multiple teams. I’ve also been heavily involved in defining testing strategy, localisation, analytics, and front-end architecture across the organisation.

I care a lot about code quality, but not in a dogmatic way. I’m opinionated about structure, testing, and long-term maintainability because I’ve seen what happens when those things are ignored. I’m a big believer in boring, predictable systems that let teams move fast without breaking production — and in writing things down so the same mistakes aren’t repeated.

Before all that, I worked across a mix of product companies and consultative environments (Ladbrokes, Whitbread, Photobox), and earlier still I co-founded a small web agency in Greece. That mix probably explains why I’m equally comfortable deep in code, in architectural discussions, or translating between product, design, and engineering.

If you want a more formal breakdown of roles, tech stacks, and projects, my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/dimitrisdamilos">LinkedIn</a> has the full timeline — this is the human version.

## Open source & side projects

### Featured open-source

#### [react-super-switch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-super-switch)

![react](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-17%2B-blue)
![typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-fully%20typed-blue)

A tiny, dependency-free React switch component focused on correctness, accessibility, and predictability.

Built to avoid the usual pitfalls of “simple” switch components (controlled vs uncontrolled confusion, broken keyboard support, unnecessary re-renders), while keeping the API minimal and explicit.

Ships at under 1KB min+gzip and is intended to be dropped into real-world codebases without ceremony.

### Experiments & small apps

#### [Art of War legions formation sharing tool](https://aowformationshare.jonur.io/)

A small utility for Art of War: Legions players to share and discuss army formations without editing screenshots. The tool normalises formation layouts into a shareable grid, making it easier to reference positions, suggest improvements, and iterate collaboratively.

#### [Costie](https://costie.jonur.io/)

A lightweight meeting cost calculator built as an experiment in privacy-first UI design. Participants’ salaries are entered locally, immediately discarded, and never stored — only the aggregated cost-per-second survives for the duration of the timer. Created partly as a practical tool, partly as a reminder that meetings are never “free”. [Read more...](https://github.com/Jonur/costie#flow)

#### EU COVID-19 Country Statistics

An EU-focused COVID-19 statistics dashboard built during the pandemic, with an emphasis on mobile UX and structured data comparison. The app aggregates daily updates and presents per-country, EU-wide, and global comparisons in a consistent, explorable format.
