## About me

I am Dimitris, a foodie, nerdy, history buff, whisky connoisseur, and metalhead. My sense of humour is weird. People also call me Jonur, it's a long story.

### My professional story

I’m a Staff Engineer based in London, currently working mainly in the React / TypeScript / Node.js space, with a strong interest in architecture, developer experience, and building things that don’t collapse under their own weight a year later.

These days my work sits less in “shipping isolated features” and more in shaping platforms: defining front-end foundations, setting standards, writing ADRs, unblocking teams, and rebuilding systems that have reached the end of their useful life. I tend to get pulled into the messy, cross-team problems — the ones where requirements are fuzzy, ownership is unclear, and the solution needs both technical depth and a lot of communication.

At Tractable, I’ve spent the last few years working across Pocket AI, the Inspection Portal, and the Auto Platform Product (APP). That’s included everything from running AI models client-side with TensorFlow.js, to rebuilding large React applications from scratch, to designing shared libraries used across multiple teams. I’ve also been heavily involved in defining testing strategy, localisation, analytics, and front-end architecture across the organisation.

I care a lot about code quality, but not in a dogmatic way. I’m opinionated about structure, testing, and long-term maintainability because I’ve seen what happens when those things are ignored. I’m a big believer in boring, predictable systems that let teams move fast without breaking production — and in writing things down so the same mistakes aren’t repeated.

Before all that, I worked across a mix of product companies and consultative environments (Ladbrokes, Whitbread, Photobox), and earlier still I co-founded a small web agency in Greece. That mix probably explains why I’m equally comfortable deep in code, in architectural discussions, or translating between product, design, and engineering.

If you want a more formal breakdown of roles, tech stacks, and projects, my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/dimitrisdamilos">LinkedIn</a> has the full timeline — this is the human version.

## Little side projects

### [Art of War legions formation sharing tool](https://aowformationshare.jonur.io/)

This small app allows Art of War: Legions players to share their formations and get formation suggestions without having to edit screenshots and it helps reference the formation squares.

### [Costie](https://costie.jonur.io/)

Costie is a meeting cost calculator. It takes the - before-tax preferably - salary amounts of the participants and runs a timer with the meeting's cost per second. The salary fields are safe in password fields and are destroyed the moment the user navigates to the timer, with the application keeping only the sum of all salaries per second.

### EU COVID-19 Country Statistics

This is an EU and mobile-UX focused monitoring tool for the coronavirus pandemic. The stats update daily and the app offers a good amount of structured data presentations for each country, the EU as a whole, as well as a comparison between the EU and the rest of the world.
